# dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files, also known as dotfiles. These files control various settings and preferences for the software I use.

## Getting Started

To use these dotfiles, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/test2user-aqil/dotfiles.git
```

Next, you'll need to create symbolic links for each file in the repository. This will allow the software to use the configuration stored in the repository instead of the default configuration.

For example, to create a symbolic link for your .zshrc file, you would run the following command:

```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

Repeat this process for each file in the repository that you want to use.

## Customizing the Configuration

Feel free to make changes to the configuration files as you see fit. I recommend keeping the changes documented by making descriptive commit messages when you push changes to the repository.

## Conclusion

That's it! You should now be able to use my configuration files on your local machine. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue in the repository.
